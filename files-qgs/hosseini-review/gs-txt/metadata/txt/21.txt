Recalling the “Imprecision” of Cross-Project Defect Prediction

There has been a great deal of interest in defect prediction: using prediction models trained on historical data to help fo- cus quality-control resources in ongoing development. Since most new projects don’t have historical data, there is interest in cross-project prediction: using data from one project to predict defects in another. Sadly, results in this area have largely been disheartening. Most experiments in cross-project defect prediction report poor performance, using the stan- dard measures of precision, recall and F-score. We argue that these IR-based measures, while broadly applicable, are not as well suited for the quality-control settings in which defect prediction models are used. Specifically, these measures are taken at specific threshold settings (typically thresholds of the predicted probability of defectiveness returned by a logistic regression model). However, in practice, software quality con- trol processes choose from a range of time-and-cost vs quality tradeoffs: how many files shall we test? how many shall we inspect? Thus, we argue that measures based on a variety of tradeoffs, viz., 5%, 10% or 20% of files tested/inspected would be more suitable. We study cross-project defect prediction from this perspective. We find that cross-project prediction performance is no worse than within-project performance, and substantially better than random prediction!
