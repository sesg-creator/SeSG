Defining and monitoring strategically aligned software improvement goals. Software engineers are always aiming at improving software processes and products. However, the adoption of these improvements on software organizations must be aligned to their strategic goals. Otherwise, these improvements may not improve the organization. However, to guarantee this alignment can be complex, since improvement initiatives would have to be planned and monitored considering aspects starting from strategic level and going all the way to the organization daily operations. Thus, this work presents an approach to define and monitor software improvement goals, which are decompositions of strategic goals and are related to software products or processes. Our approach comprises strategic, tactical and operational planning activities, always aiming at strategic alignment. As important tools to monitor the goals defined, software measurement and statistical process control are also considered. An infrastructure to monitor the goals is described, and also an experience of use of the approach at a Brazilian software development organization.
