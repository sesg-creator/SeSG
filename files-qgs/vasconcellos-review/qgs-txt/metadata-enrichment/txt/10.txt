The Rosetta Stone Methodology - a benefits driven approach to software process improvement. In response to the lack of a business-focused approach to software process improvement (SPI), the Rosetta Stone objective-driven SPI Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake SPI based on business-driven objectives using proven SPI methodologies. To demonstrate usefulness and practicality, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed using a generic set of business objectives which are mapped to the CMMI (Staged) model using a modified version of GQM. This methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.
