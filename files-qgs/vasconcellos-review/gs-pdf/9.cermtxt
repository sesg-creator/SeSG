Abstract
Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from Software
Engineering Institute has been used successfully by many
organizations for software process improvement. However,
there exists a disconnection between business goals and
maturity levels. A new framework using Quality Function
Deployment (QFD) is developed to deal with this problem.
This framework serves three purposes: (1) it provides a
connection between business requirements and CMM; (2) it
proposed a methodology for the priority assessment of
requirements from multiple perspectives; and (3) it helps
identify a set of software process improvement actions
based on business requirements and CMM.
1. Introduction
In this era of rapid technological innovation and
changes, the key to the survival of a software company
relies on the continuous improvement of its process. When
talking about Software Process Improvement (SPI), many
of the software development organizations think about
existing models and standards, such as ISO 9000 series of
standards, CMM [2,3], etc. Among all these models, it is
unfair to make a judgment on which one is better. However,
considering the more detailed guidance and greater breadth
provided by CMM, it may be a better choice for some
software development organizations [4].

(CMMI-SE/SW) has been developed to solve the problem
of using multiple CMM models for different areas of
application, CMM has been working so well in many
organizations that they do not have plans to replace CMM
with CMMI immdediately. However, similar to the other
SPI models/standards, it does not address the connection
between its maturity levels and the business goals of an
organization. In other words, an organization cannot see an
explicit reason to reach a higher maturity level in terms of
satisfying business goals. In addition, like all other
standards and models on SPI, CMM addresses “what to do”
while leaving “how to do” to organizations. Therefore,
some methodology is needed to transform CMM activities
into actions which are detailed enough to follow by
software engineers.
This paper develops a framework which helps map
business and other requirements to CMM, and helps
develop action plans to satisfy those requirements and
CMM goals using QFD which is a methodology for
building the voice of the customer, both spoken and
unspoken, into a product. Unlike traditional quality systems
which aim at minimizing negative quality in a product,
QFD adds values to the product by maximizing the positive
quality [5]. Nowadays, QFD has been applied to virtually
every industry and business, including software
development [14]. However, one of the important
components of QFD, which focuses on improving the
process quality by assuring that organizational processes
and actions are in compliance with established standards,
has been neglected by most QFD followers in the business
[6].
Several attempts have been made to integrate QFD into
SPI. Ita Richardson proposed a four-stage model for
software process improvement in small companies [8,11].
The measurements in the model are based on self
assessment of software process. This model is unsuitable for
large companies because self-assessment is difficult across
groups.
Zultner's Business Process Reengineering model with
QFD [7] uses either the major competitor's performance or
creative thoughts of employees, but not existing standards,
as the source of process improvement. This may cause
inefficiency or difficulty in replicating this approach in
different situations or environments.
SAP also uses QFD in SPI [9]. Although this approach
considers the participation of multiple stakeholders, it treats
requirements from all stakeholders as equally important and
it does not consider the relationships between multiple
perspectives. In addition, the process improvements actions
are directly related to process requirements. No standards,
such as ISO or CMM, are considered throughout the
workflow. Therefore, although the action plan is prioritized,
it may be unreliable.
2. Our research approach
Our approach develops a methodology which derives
action plans based on software process requirements and in
accordance with CMM because CMM is still being used by
many organizations. In our framework, QFD is used to help
an organization achieve three objectives. Firstly, business
and other requirements within an organization are mapped
to CMM goals and activities. A connection is established so
that the organization can see clearly how CMM helps with
its business. Secondly, software process requirements from
multiples perspectives are prioritized so that requirements
with more and stronger impacts on other requirements can
receive higher priority values. Thirdly, QFD helps
transform requirements of the organization into process
actions through Key Process Areas (KPAs). This guarantees
that the actions are in accordance with CMM and, at the
same time, satisfy the process requirements from the
organization. This directly results in the improvement of the
organization process.
The framework is designed in such a way that the
requirements from a particular perspective are prioritized
within perspectives. At the same time, each perspective
carries its own priority. The requirements from multiple
perspectives are correlated with each other. As a result, the
priority value of each requirement is adjusted after their
impacts of requirements from other perspectives are
assessed.
These set of requirements with adjusted priorities are
related to key goals in CMM KPAs. The goals are
prioritized based on process requirements. Hence the goals
which achieve higher overall satisfaction of process
requirements get higher importance. In order to achieve
these goals, CMM has Key Practices (KPs) categorized into
five common features. These KPs in each category are
prioritized separately based on the priorities of goals. KPs
which aim to achieve higher overall satisfaction of goals get
higher importance. A separate set of action plans is derived
from KPs in each of the common features. The actions
which help to support more important key practices get
higher priorities. As a result, the action plan follows the
standards in CMM and corresponds to process requirements,
and actions with higher importance help to achieve higher
stakeholder satisfaction.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 3 describes our software process improvement
framework. The detailed matrices development used in the
framework is explained in section 4. Section 5 introduces
variations of the framework. An SPI example using our
framework is summarized in section 6, and the concluding
section provides a discussion on the significance.
3. Framework for
improvement using QFD
software
process
This SPI framework uses CMM model as its foundation
and QFD as its tool. The advantage of this framework is
that the requirements from various perspectives are
incorporated into the final set of actions which are detailed
enough to be performed.

Figure 1. Software Process Improvement through
CMM Using QFD
In the first phase of the framework, the requirements
toward the organizational process are gathered from various
branches/departments. In Figure 1, various perspectives are
represented as P1 through Pn. Each perspective contains
multiple requirements. These perspectives are then
prioritized based on their relative importance within the
organization and integrated into one single set of
requirements. The prioritization ensures that requirements
from different perspectives are comparable with each other
and the integration reflects their correlations.
The second through the fourth phases of this
framework are applied to level 2 to 5 of CMM. In the
second phase, goals of all KPAs in a CMM level are
selected and prioritized based on the requirements from the
previous phase. A house of quality is used to establish
relationships between requirements from the organization
and KPA goals from CMM. This house of quality
demonstrates that complying with CMM standard also helps
satisfy the business and other requirements in the
organization.
The third phase of our framework involves the
prioritization of KPs within all KPAs of a specific level.
The prioritization is based on the deliverables from the
previous phase. In order to incorporate requirements into
final action plan, these KPs have to be prioritized based on
KPA goals which are now reflecting requirement priorities.
In the fourth phase of our framework, a set of actions
are derived from the prioritized KPs. These activities reflect
the requirements integrated in the first phase. Meanwhile,
they also state what needs to be achieved in order to reach a
particular maturity level. These action plans become the
guideline of the process improvement. Thus, more resource
should be assigned to those actions with high priorities.
4. Matrices in our framework
Four different matrices are used in the four phases of
our framework.
4.1 Phase 1 - Requirements Impact Matrix
We use a relationship matrix called Requirements
Impact Matrix (RI Matrix) to help with the requirements
integration. But before that, a requirements prioritization
technique can be used to integrate all requirements into one
single set. The following steps are followed to produce
perspective weights and requirement local priorities.
1. Establish a linkage between each pair of perspectives
in the set by identifying the relative dominance values
rd1,2 between perspectives 1 and 2 using the following
equation [13]:
rd1,2 = n2/n1
where: n1 is satisfaction degree of perspective 1,
n2 is satisfaction degree of perspective 2.
2. Calculate the local priority of each perspective. For n
perspectives, P1, P2, ,…, Pn, in a decreasing order of
importance, let rdi,j denote the relative dominance of
the perspective Pi over Pj, and let WPi denote the
numeric priority of perspective Ri. First, Pn is assigned
with a priority (WPn) of one. All remaining perspective
priorities can be determined recursively using [13]:
For 1 ≤ i < n, WPi-1 = WPi * rd i-1, i
3. Within perspectives, requirements are prioritized using
the same method described in steps 1 and 2 to derive
the local priorities.
Local requirements priorities are normalized within
perspectives before being multiplied by its perspective
weight to produce initial global priorities [12,13]. These
initial global priorities of requirements are used in the RI
Matrix for requirements integration.
The following steps calculate weighted priorities of
requirements from one perspective with effects from
another using RI Matrix as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Requirements Impact (RI) Matrix
1. Enter all requirements from one perspective with their
initial global priorities into rows.
2. Enter all requirements from another perspective into
columns, with their initial global priorities entered in
the cells immediately below them.
3. Determine the impact relations between requirements
from different perspectives. The types of impact
relationships are shown in Table 1.

4. Calculate the weighted priorities using Equation.
WPij, k = W ij * M∑k W lk * IR(Rij , Rlk) (Equation 1)
l = 1
where: WPij, k is the weighted priority for requirement j
in perspective i with effects from perspective k;
IR(Rij , Rlk) is the impact relationship between
requirement j from perspective i and requirement l from
perspective k;
i is the initial global priority of requirement j
W j
from perspective i.
An RI Matrix is constructed between each pair of
perspectives. After all RI Matrices are constructed, the
summations of all weighted priorities (WP) for the same
requirement become the final weight. These final weights
are normalized into normalized weights (NW) before being
combined with the initial global priorities using an
adjustment factor α between 0 and 1:
AP j = W j + α * NW j
(Equation 2)
The result from the above equation is the adjusted
priority (AP) which is delivered to phase 2.
4.2 Phase 2 - Requirements-Goals Impact Matrix
Figure 3. Requirements-Goals Impact (RG) Matrix
In this phase we use the Requirements-Goals Impact
Matrix (RG Matrix) to prioritize KPA goals on the basis of
the adjusted priorities (APs) from phase 1. KPA goals are
listed for each KPA in CMM.
Figure 3 illustrates the components of an RG Matrix.
The following five steps guides through the process of
building the RG Matrix.
1. Enter integrated requirements (from previous phase)
and their adjusted priorities into rows.
2. Enter goals in all KPAs of a particular maturity level
into columns.
3. Determine the impact relations between each
requirement and each KPA goal. The same set of
symbols in Table 1 is used in this matrix.
4. Calculate the weighted importance values (FG) using
formula:
FGi = M∑ AP j *IR(Gi , R j) (Equation 3)
j = 1
5. Normalize the weighted importance values (NG).
4.3 Phase 3 - Goals-Practices Impact Matrix
Goals-Practices Impact Matrix (GP matrix) maps KPA
goals to KPs. The following steps construct a GP matrix as
shown in Figure 4.
1. Enter CMM goals in RG matrix together with their
normalized importance values (NG) into rows of GP
matrix as indicated.
2. List the KPs in the desired common feature as columns
of the matrix.

3. Determine the impact relationship between each goal
and each KP. The same symbols in Table 1 are used in
this matrix.
4. Calculate the weighted importance values (FKP) of key
practices using formula:
FKPi = ∑S NG j *IR(KPi , G j) (Equation 4)
j = 1
5. Normalize the weighted importance values of key
practices into NKPs.
4.4 Phase 4 - Action Plan House of Quality Matrix
Action plans are developed on the basis of key
practices and their correlations are determined using APHoQ
matrix. The following six steps are used to develop an
AP-HoQ matrix as shown in Figure 5.
1. Enter CMM key practices together with normalized
importance values (NKP) into rows.
2. Derive a set of actions from the key practices in each
KPA and enter them into columns as indicated. A set of
actions is derived separately for each common feature.
3. Determine the impact relationship between each KP
and each action. The same set of symbols in Table 1 is
used in this matrix.
4. Calculate the weighted importance of actions using
formula:
FAi = ∑Z NKP j *IR( Ai , KP j) (Equation 5)
j = 1
5. Calculate the normalized importance of actions.
6. Determine the impacts of actions on each other in the
roof. A plus sign (+) is used to indicate the existence of
impacts.

5. Simplified frameworks
One of the advantages of the proposed framework is
that, when the schedule and budget become tight, this
framework can be modified for a faster process
improvement. We give the name “light-weight frameworks”
to differentiate the variations which will be introduced in
this section from the “comprehensive framework”
introduced in the previous two sections. Although these
light-weight frameworks help solve the problem of tight
schedule and budget, they may not produce results as
accurately as the original framework does. It is
recommended that when schedule and budget allow, in
order to gain accuracy in the final result, an organization
makes as few modifications from the comprehensive
framework as possible. However, accuracy may not always
be the top concern to an organization. In this case, three
Light-Weight Frameworks can be applied.
Light-weight framework 1 simplifies phase 1 of the
comprehensive framework. Process improvement groups
may choose to integrate requirements without using the RI
matrix. Arbitrary weights can be assigned to requirements
and these arbitrarily ranked requirements are delivered to
phase 2. To further speed up phase 1, process improvement
groups may even choose to collect requirements from only
the most important group instead of from all related groups
and no requirements integration is needed.
Light-weight framework 2 simplifies the mapping from
requirements to CMM and from CMM to action plans in the
comprehensive framework. An organization may choose to
use either the KPA goals or KPs instead of both. For
instance, requirements are mapped to KPA goals and these
goals can be mapped to action plans directly. Phase 1
remains the same as that in the comprehensive framework.
An organization may even choose Light-weight
framework 3 by combining the first two light-weight
frameworks mentioned above.
6. Evaluation
In order to validate our framework, a case study based
on the comprehensive framework was developed. A
software development organization is considering
improving its software process. Eighteen requirements are
collected from three perspectives-business, management,
and quality-within the company, with 6 requirements in
each perspective. These requirements are integrated using
RI Matrices as introduced in section 4.1. Figure 6 shows the
integration of business and management perspectives. When
the requirements from all three perspectives are integrated,
we have the adjusted weights (AW) ready to be delivered to
phase 2.The RG, GP and AP-HoQ matrices are then used to
transform these requirements into a set of prioritized actions.

Figure 6. Business Requirements and
Management Requirements
Based on the normalized weighted importance values
in the AP-HoQ matrix, we can sort all action plans in a
decreasing order. Since these action plans are derived based
on CMM KPs, their execution will help the organization
achieve a higher maturity level. At the same time,
stakeholder requirements from multiple perspectives have
also been reflected in the action plans. The action plans at
the top of the list can better satisfy stakeholder requirements
and should receive more resources than those listed after
them.
From the result of this case study, we found the
presented framework helpful in generating action plans for
SPI, in prioritizing stakeholder requirements, and in relating
stakeholder requirements with these action plans. While the
prioritized action plans are the final deliverable of SPI, the
stakeholder requirements serve as the root of our framework.
This is reasonable because all SPIs have to satisfy
requirements from certain stakeholders. By providing a
methodology for requirements prioritization, we first
identify requirements with more and stronger correlations
with other requirements from multiple stakeholders.
Satisfying these requirements will also satisfy other
requirements to some extent. Therefore, they receive higher
priority values in this framework. When action plans are
connected to these requirements, the priority values of
requirements are transformed into priority values of actions
plans.
The benefit of prioritizing the final action plans lies in
the fact that sometimes not all actions can be performed
within schedule. When this is the case, by executing the
action plans with higher priorities first, we can always
achieve higher satisfaction level of requirements.
After small scale experiments, our framework will be
further validated by the Toshiba Corporation in a large scale
environment. We will report the results in the future.
7. Conclusion
Software Process Improvement has received attention
from more and more software development organizations
nowadays. It is a common practice for an organization,
especially a large organization, to select a software
engineering standard and model for its process
improvement. CMM from SEI as a software process
improvement framework has become very influential in
software development world. However, CMM only
provides practices which are needed to be performed
without specifying how. In addition, they are not directly
related to business goals and other requirements. Our
project successfully addressed this issue by using QFD as a
tool to connect requirements within an organization to the
action plan for its process improvement through KPA goals
and KPs in CMM. In this paper, we discussed in detail how
to prioritize and integrate requirements, how to map
requirements to CMM goals, how to prioritize CMM KPs,
and how to generate and prioritize action plans. Three
objectives are achieved through our framework: 1) business
and other requirements of an organization are successfully
connected with the KPA goals and KPs in CMM; 2)
software process requirements from multiple perspectives
are successfully prioritized based on their impact
correlations with each other; and 3) process improvement
actions are successfully prioritized according to
organization requirements through KPAs and KPs.
CMMI has been developed to solve the problem of
using multiple CMM models for different areas of
22
6
application. While the basic ideas remain the same in CMM
and CMMI, the primary difference is that, in CMMI,
especially in the continuous model, process improvements
are designated to individual Process Areas (PA) rather than
the whole process. Our framework needs to be adjusted
accordingly so that a list of action plans is generated for
each PA. Considering the connections (similarities) between
the two models, this framework adjustment should not be
overwhelming. This framework adjustment can be part of
our future work.
