Aggregating viewpoints for strategic software
process improvement-a method and a case study
D. Karlstrom, P. Runeson and C. Wohlin
Abstract: Decisions regarding strategic software process improvement (SPI) are generally based
on the management's viewpoint of the situation, and in some cases also the viewpoints of some
kind of an SPI group. This may result in strategies which are not accepted throughout the
organisation, as the views of how the process is functioning are different throughout the company.
A method for identifying the major factors affecting a process-improvement goal and how the
perception of the importance of the factors varies throughout the organisation are described
The method lets individuals from the whole development organisation rate the expected effect of
these factors from their own viewpoint. In this way the strategic SPI decision can be taken using
input from the entire organisation, and any discrepancies in the ratings can also give important
SPI- decision information. The method is applied to a case study performed at Fuji Xerox, Tokyo.
In the case study, significantly different profiles of the factor ratings came from management
compared with those from the engineering staff. This result can be used to support the strategy
decision as such, but also to anchor the decision in the organisation.
1 Introduction
The need for software process improvement (SPI) is well
known and also increasingly accepted as a means for a
software company to stay competitive in a rapidly changing
environment. However, when it comes to which strategy
to follow in an SPI programme, there are many
different opinions in a software organisation. For example,
quality-assurance staff may tend to stress the importance of
the documented processes, while engineers may tend to
rely on better tools. One of the contributing factors to such
differences is that the documented process is not the same
as the actual work performed. Roles and workflows are
documented in official descriptions, but the actual roles
and work performed are a combination of past practices,
each person's interpretation of the official documents and
the effects of training programmes.
Decisions made to improve the development processes
as a part of a software process-improvement initiative are
in most cases taken by a select group of people with their
specific views of the entire process. If the different
viewpoints in the organisation are not taken into account,
there is a risk that the SPI initiative is not sufficiently
accepted, and hence the goals will not be implemented
effectively.
After the need for an improvement effort is realised and
accepted by the company, an initial phase begins when

sponsorship, goals and strategies are confirmed for the
duration of the improvement effort. The current status of
the company's development must then be measured or
assessed before any improvement attempts can be made.
The steps to be taken for SPI as described by Humphrey [ I ]
can be generalised into the steps shown in Fig. 1. These are
also the main steps of the more advanced SPI method
called the IDEAL process [2] introduced by SEI.
This paper focuses on the goal and analysis part of the
SPI model shown in Fig. 1. It presents a method that
supports SPI decisions to be taken with knowledge about
the different interpretations that each person has made of
the current status of the development process and their own
role in the process. The method is divided into five main
steps, for which a flow diagram is provided in Fig. 2.
Step A : determine goal;
Step B: identify major factors believed to be affecting the
goal;
Step C: allow the organisation to rate the factors anonymously
based on their personal viewpoints;
Step D: analysis of data. Aggregate and analyse the rating
results and identify discrepancies; and
Step E: SPI strategy decision.
The method provides decision-support information to SPIresponsible
individuals by identifying the perceived most
effective improvement factors and by analysing discrepancies

between different viewpoints throughout the organisation.
The advantage is that it provides systematically derived
information, which supports decision makers in the decisions
on what to improve and how to improve it. Metric
analysis can be one method of identifying improvement
factors. A general process-frameworklappraisal method
such as the CMM [2] is another. However, factors outside
these frameworks may be just as important since they are
derived from the individual company. Hence, they should
most definitely not be excluded. An example of such
factors is provided by Cattaneo et al. [ 3 ] by demonstrating
the need for organisational restructuring within development
companies prior to, or in combination with, CMMbased
SPI work.
Herbsleb et al. show the importance of management
involvement in successful CMM-based SPI in their survey
of companies using the framework [4]. By making information
available about the views on process-improvement
alternatives, the method presented in this paper is thought
to be able to improve management involvement in
organisations.

Process distortion and viewpoints
In a process-improvement initiative, there may be different
opinions on what should be improved to reach the improvement
goal. To some extent, this depends on the different
viewpoints on what the process actually is.
Development processes are documented in official documents
but, as they are interpreted, different versions appear
depending on the perception of the process. Bandinelli
et al. describe these different perceptions of the process

and names these as the 'official', 'perceived' and 'desired'
process [ 5 ] . To this list can be added the process that is
actually performed, the actual process and the observations
made by SPI-responsible people, the observed process. The
relations between the processes are illustrated in Fig. 3 .
Note that of all the processes shown in Fig. 3, only the
actual process produces the product and the only absolutely
accessible process is the official process.
The mechanisms between the different processes are
summarised in Table 1. The most complicated process
transition is between the official and the perceived process.
The individual person's perceived process is affected by an
individual interpretation of the official process, both as a
result of reading it directly and as a result of some form of
training. The perceived process is also affected by how
coworkers communicate their perceptions of the process
and by observation of the coworkers' actual execution of
the process. Finally, processes that have been in effect in
the past also affect the perceived process.

Of the processes mentioned, the observed, desired and
perceived processes are subject to viewpoints [6] by each
person that is involved with this process. This means that
each individual person's perception of this aspect of
the process is different. The only externally observable
processes are the official process, documented by official
process documents, and the actual process, which consists
of the actual actions that agents perform to produce the
product. As the product is the result of the actual process,
the SPI strategy must be to improve this process and make
inconsistencies between the actual and the official
processes as few and small as possible.
Sommerville et al. introduce the concept of viewpoints
to software processes [6]. Several of the processes
described in this paper thus far are subject to different
persons in the company having different viewpoints. The
observed process is subject to each SPI-responsible
person's interpretation, or viewpoint. The desired process
is subject to the interpretation and application of reference
processes and personal opinions of the SPI people. The
perceived process is, as previously described, affected by
many factors and each person has their own perceived
process.
Herbsleb et al. [4] analyse responses from respondents
with differing roles within the companies using CMMbased
SPI in their survey. No statistical differences are
shown between different roles, but only one person in each
role is used from each company.
This paper focuses on using people's perception, or
viewpoint, of the official and actual processes to help
decision-making in process improvements.

Method
To support the strategy choice for an SPI initiative, a
method is developed which involves the viewpoints of
different roles in the software-development organisation.
In the description of the method, the general model for SPI
presented in Fig. 1 has been followed, with the additional
steps shown in Fig. 2 regarding the selection of which
factors to implement.
3. I Determine goal
The first stage of an SPI initiative is to determine the goal
for the process improvement. The goal has to be set in line
with the business goals of the organisation. Any method
that works in the organisation and produces a list of goals
can be used. For instance, the goals of the CMM [ 2 ] can be
used according to the current maturity level of the
company.
3.2 Identify major factors
Once a goal has been determined, factors thought to be
affecting this goal need to be identified (see Fig. 4). The
main focus of this paper is not, however, this identification
of factors, but the subsequent rating and use of the results
of these ratings.
Each goal must be possible to realise by factors affecting
the development process. If it is not, it is an unrealisable
goal, and therefore uninteresting to the SPI work. A factor
is defined as a possible change in the process, organisation,
or environment that is believed to cause a change in the
development process towards the goals associated with
the factor.
Each factor has an actual effect and an actual cost that
cannot be estimated accurately beforehand, if at all.
IEE Proc.-Sofi.,Vol. 149, No. 5, October 2002
affected by
factor
Fig. 4 Relationship between goals and fuctors
However, the perception of the effect and cost of the
introduction of the factors may provide enough information
to identify the best factors for implementation. As
these factors are to be rated for one goal at a time, the exact
correlation between the factors and the goal is not as
important as covering all factors that are possible to
implement for the goal. This is because factors that are
thought not to affect the goal during the rating should be
rated low.
The number of factors used in the formal evaluation
exercise is constrained by the time available for each
person to complete the rating procedure. This must be
decided taking into account the expected benefit of the
whole procedure. In the next method step, painvise
comparisons between the factors are performed, and an
estimation of the time taken for the persons to complete the
rating procedure can be performed by estimating a maximum
and minimum time for reading an introductory text
for the rating procedure and a maximum and minimum
time for each comparison. From this a low and high
estimation can be calculated for the total completion time
and a cost/benefit decision can be taken. If the method
has proven successful previously, a larger number of
factors may be used the next time. With the rating
scheme used in this paper, n*(n - 1)/2 comparisons are
performed to compare n factors. If the number of people in
the organisation is large, some form of sampling should be
undertaken. The subjects were randomly assigned one of
four randomly ordered rating pages to ensure that the order
of the comparisons did not affect the results.
The goal/factor structure presented here is similar to the
structure of goals, questions and metrics in the GQM
method [7]. The GQM method, however, uses direct
measures available in the actual process to measure aspects
thereof to achieve the set goal by answering the questions
associated with the goal. The method presented in this
paper uses the perceptions of the individual persons to
indicate the major factors contributing to the improvement
goal. The method is, of course, affected by the factors
selected for the rating. If a major factor is not identified, or
omitted, this will mean that the factor finally selected might
not be the ultimate one. The method of selecting factors
should therefore be carefully selected and tailored to the
situation.
145
Other methods for identifying factors can be studying
past SPI strategies and their effect. Studying the effect of
SPI in other companies is a further possibility.
3.3 Rate the factors
The rating of the factors is to be performed by a suitable
sample of all people involved in the development organisation
that are active in the process. In a small organisation, a
complete sample can be used, but in a large organisation
this is not possible. The sample should be designed to
ensure that all vertical levels of the organisation (Le.
management levels) and all horizontal groups (i.e. development
teams, departments) are represented. The purpose
of this is to ensure that all sources of different viewpoints
should be represented in the sample.
The method used for rating the factors is called the
'analytic-hierarchy process' (AHP). The AHP is a method
for evaluating options in a choice situation [8, 91. It uses
pairwise comparisons and measures each option's relative
contribution to the rating. Each subjects' individual set of
comparisons is put into a judgment matrix. From this
matrix the relative weights for the items compared can be
calculated for each individual. These relative weights
are known as priorities. The process also gives the
possibility of calculating how consistent the performed
ratings are for each individual, as the painvise comparisons
imply that the options are indirectly compared
several times.
The AHP process has been implemented for applications
outside the process-improvement domain. Karlsson et al.
[SI, for example, uses the process to select between
customer requirements. This method of comparing requirements
has been further developed into a commercial tool
developed by Focalpoint AB [lo]. This tool was not used
for the experiment as it does not give full control over the
algorithms used for calculating the results.
3.4 Analysis of data
This step consists of two parts. First the whole data set is
analysed and then comparisons are made between groups
in the data to identify discrepancies within the organisation.
To compare the relative importance of each factor, the
rating results are aggregated first overall and then in each
group. When aggregating results from an AHP-comparison
process one must decide whether one wishes to aggregate
the judgments of each individual or the priorities calculated
for each individual. This is referred to as aggregation
of individual judgments (AIJ) and aggregation of individual
priorities (ATP), respectively. The decision is determined
by whether the group is assumed to act as a unit or
as separate individuals [ l 11. Secondly it must be decided
whether to use the arithmetic or geometric mean for the
aggregation. For AIJ, the geometric mean must be used.
For AIP, any of the two may be used, but the arithmetic
mean has the advantage of being comparable with the
original values. AIP has been chosen in this paper for
aggregation with arithmetical means.
The statistical methods described in this section are
examples of appropriate methods for analysis of the data.
There are several other methods that are appropriate and
could be used.
3.4.1 Overall analysis: An overall view of the data
can be given by using box plots and descriptive statistics.
Further analysis of the ratings can be performed using an
ANOVA test [12], if the data is normally distributed and
146
the variances are equal. Significant rating differences can
then be established within each group using Fisher's PLSD
test [12]. The normal properties of the data are checked
using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution.
If the assumptions for ANOVA are not met by the data, a
Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test can be performed
instead [131.
3.4.2 Identify discrepancies: Discrepancies between
groups of persons can give vital SP1-strategy information.
The ratings of one factor by two groups are compared
using an unpaired t-test if the ratings are normally distributed.
If the ratings are not normally distributed, a MannWhitney
test is performed [131. A comparison of ratings in
each group can be performed using the methods described
for the overall results in Section 3.4.
3.5 SPI-strategy decision
The final outcome of the method is an overview of the
expected impact of factors to improve in a development
organisation and an idea of the difference between the
groups in the organisation. The systematic nature of the
method implies that one can be fairly sure that the results
are valid as decision-support material for the SPI strategy.
The final decision will, of course, be taking other information
into account as well. This is not an automatic decisiontaking
method.

Case study at Fuji Xerox
4.1 The company
The method presented in Section 3 is applied in a case
study at Fuji Xerox in Tokyo, Japan. Fuji Xerox Group is a
joint venture owned by Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. and Xerox
Ltd. of the UK. Fuji Xerox operates in the Asia-Pacific and
Oceania regions as a member of the world wide Xerox
Group. The company has approximately 15 000 employees
in its operating area.
The company's principal business is the manufacturing
and selling of office-automation equipment such as copiers
and low-end laser printers, collectively referred to as the
document-services business. Other businesses include
logistics and educational services. Fuji Xerox also
performs research and development, marketing and service
activities on behalf of the global Xerox Group.
4.2 Fuji Xerox SPI background
The SPI process at Fuji Xerox (FX) began in 1995 when a
proposition to introduce the SW-CMM won management
approval. The company had an initial CMM assessment in
April 1996 and was found to be operating at level 1.
Tmprovement-action teams (IAT) were started in July
1996 to prepare for pilot projects operating at level 2. The
pilot projects were started in April 1997 and were reviewed
in June of the same year. FX was assessed to be operating
at level 2 in April 1998. The SPI work has continued and
the organisation was due to start pilot projects for level 3
operations in April 2000.
Occurrences of major events during the process initiative
are illustrated in Fig. 5 . The goal of the program was to
increase productivity and quality in the development
process by working in the following three areas:
(a) increase management visibility into ongoing projects;
( 6 ) activate more capability from the engineers using
CMM; and
( c ) achieve dynamic resource rotation.

Fig. 5 Major events in the SPI initiative
W pilot project
Fuji Xerox was at the time of starting the programme
experiencing problems in the development of software.
Two major factors were identified as causes:
(i) an increase in the size of the code in many projects
by a factor 10 from 1990 to 1995 (from approximately
100 KLOC to approximately 1 MLOC); and
(ii) the invisible nature of software.
The size of the code meant that a team consisting of one
team leader and a group of developers was not sufficient to
develop the software product in a reasonable time. Instead
the projects needed to be split up into several groups of
developers and group leaders. This introduced new management
and communication aspects that were hard to solve.
During the spring of 2001, Fuji Xerox has been successfully
assessed at CMM level 3 and is operating several
projects at level 3. The degree of deployment of level 2 was
unknown in the spring of 2000 but it was estimated by
members of the process-improvement group that, among
the projects that have started the initiative, approximately
80% of the key process areas for level 2 are satisfied.
The Copier Platform and Systems (CP&S) unit, where
the case study was performed, has approximately 800
engineers working with software development for Fuji
Xerox document systems. The software is both embedded
software for integration in copiers and printers and also
independent software products for systems concerned with
document handling.
Fuji Xerox employs a matrix organisational structure
[ 141 for development projects. Project managers are
responsible for co-ordinating and completing projects
while the group leaders are responsible for providing the
functional resources to the projects.
4.3 Determine the goal
The goal determined at Fuji Xerox was identified by looking
at the original intent of the SPI initiative and discussing this
with the management concerned. One of the important goals
of the SPI initiative was to increase management 'visibility'
into ongoing projects. It was hence decided that this was one
of the main goals to analyse.
Visibility concerns the information flow between the
ongoing development projects and the responsible management
and can be defined as: 'the ease and accuracy with
which it is possible to assess the status of a project's cost,
schedule, functionality, or other characteristics'. [151
Information reaches management in three ways:
(i) periodical reporting: routine procedures that require
reports or other forms of information to be produced and
sent to management;
(ii) On-demand infornzation: management asks for specific
information from the project; and
(iii) General impressions: impressions obtained during
day-to-day activities.
In an organisation with low visibility, information is only
available and accurate in the close vicinity of the source.
IEE Proc.-Soft~~V.o,l. 149, No. 5, October 2002
Hence, if someone outside this area requires information,
the information has to be collected. This is usually
performed in a nonstandard fashion in a low-visibility
organisation. The information is therefore not comparable
with information from other parts of the organisation, and
when it has been collected it may well already be out of
date. In an organisation with high visibility, relevant
information is collected in a standardised fashion and
made available to authorised people as they need it.
4.4 Identify major factors
The next step is to identify the factors, which affect the
goal. The factors affecting management's visibility into
development projects were identified by a qualitative study,
observing the SPI work performed at Fuji Xerox. The
study was limited to SPI work within the CP&S unit as
this unit has been making a software-process-improvement
effort since 1995. Many of the observations were made in
conjunction with the improvement-action-team (IAT)
meetings held under two week-long periods during the
spring of 2000.
The study performed is of a single-execution nature and
it is of the holistic type as the study concerns the SPI work
within one division of Fuji Xerox during one single period
of time [16]. During the case study, no consideration was
given to the situation within specific departments.
The observations made can be divided into three different
categories depending on the source of the information:
( a ) general information provided as a background to Fuji
Xerox development;
( b ) impressions obtained during regular meetings with
representatives from Fuji Xerox process-improvement
group; and
(c) impressions obtained during IAT workshop weeks.
General information was collected through impressions
during the stay at Fuji Xerox, brochures and internal
documents provided by Fuji Xerox. The meetings held
every two weeks with Fuji Xerox process experts were
intended to keep track of the project, but also provided
information about the actual development performed at
Fuji Xerox and an opportunity for questions to be
answered.
The IAT workshops were the most productive sources of
information for process-improvement information. This
was for the following reasons:
(i) Process improvement is the main focus of these meetings.
(ii) A CMM expert consultant was present and willing to
discuss the Fuji Xerox situation.
(iii) An interpreter was present and thereby solved any
direct communication difficulties.
The IAT workshops were held on two occasions during the
course of the case study. Each workshop was a week-long
session dealing with current issues of the SPI work. The
main goal of the SPI work was intended to progress the
development process on the CMM scale. The following
people were present at the workshops:
0 IAT team members,
0 the CMM consultant and certified lead assessor,
0 a Japanese-English interpreter, and
0 people relevant to the each current topic.
During each IAT workshop, a special session was allocated
to discussions regarding the SPI work described in this
paper. A summary of the seven factors finally used in the
I47
AHP rating are is presented in Table 2. These factors affect
the software process throughout the whole company.
4.5 Rate the factors
Senior Fuji Xerox management authorised a survey scope
of approximately 160 subjects based on the estimated
completion range of 24-52min per subject. The subjects
were to be chosen from within the CP&S unit consisting of
800 people in total. After consulting with Fuji Xerox
representatives, the strategy for choosing subjects was
determined as follows:
(i) Subjects should be chosen from projects that were a
part of the process-improvement initiative.
(ii) Project traits should be comparable using the survey
(i.e. a sufficient number of people from each project should
be sampled to establish an impression of differences
between projects).
(iii) Organisation-level traits should be comparable (i.e.
differences between management and engineers should be
apparent, if present).
The AHP rating was performed using a web-based form.
The web pages were created in English and then translated
to Japanese by a translator. The Japanese content of the
web pages was reviewed by Fuji Xerox process experts
together with the author of the form so that the content was
as correct as possible in the following aspects:
content was in correct Japanese.
content was correct in software-engineering terminology.
content was presented in a Japanese style.
This translation strategy implied that the content of the
Japanese version was not a word-for-word exact translation
of the English original. This was deliberately avoided to
make the survey as effective as possible, as the terminology
involved is very different in the two languages.
The web pages first presents the purpose of the rating and
instructions for the rating system. Then the concept of
visibility used in this study is explained. This is followed
by a description of all the factors to be compared. Finally
the actual rating form is presented. The rating form itself is
divided into two parts. The first part is intended to gather
information from the subject in order to classify the subject.
Classification is performed using the subject's role in the
functional organisation, either 'management' or 'engineer'.
Management is defined as the three levels called division
manager, group leader and function manager in the Fuji
Table 2: SPI factors identified in the case study
Xerox functional organisation. Engineer is defined as the
two levels called subleader and engineer.
The second part of the survey is the rating part. Each
rating is presented with the factors to be rated on each side
of a series of buttons that each represents a degree of
choice in the AHP scale. All keywords are hyperlinked to
short descriptions. The rating sheet is randomly chosen
as one of four different randomly ordered rating sheets to
address validity issues. An example of a rating is shown in
Fig. 6. When all the ratings have been completed the form
is submitted and a 'thank you' page is shown. The results
are written to a database on the web server.
Test runs were performed on two occasions with two
subjects on each occasion. The subjects' impressions from
these test runs were used to improve the contents of the
survey. The test runs also verified that the server was
reachable from all relevant development facilities around
Tokyo, many at significant distances from the physical
location of the server.
The actual rating started with an e-mail sent to all 148
selected subjects explaining the purpose and reason for the
rating and how to access the server. The server was
available for a period of 11 days. During this time 75
subjects completed the rating procedure. Of these, eightsubjects
were later removed owing to lack of consistency in
their ratings. The consistency of each individual's ratings
was appraised using the consistency ratio calculated
according to the AHP method. The consistency-ratio
limit was set to 0.15, well below the limit of 0.2 that has
been deemed acceptable in practice [SI, which is good.
4.6 Analysis
The analysis of the rating data is divided into two steps as
described in the method section. First all the data were
analysed to obtain an overall view of the trends in the data.
Then checks were made for significant differences between
the groups.
4.6. I Overall analysis: All the ratings were plotted in
a box plot in order to get an overview of the whole data set.
The box plot is shown in Fig. 7 .
The results were first aggregated using the arithmetic
mean of the ratings for each factor, after outliers had
been removed based on their consistency ratio, as
described in Section 3.4. The means are presented in
the 'mean' column in Table 3. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test was then performed on the data to check if it was

of the other three, the test could not reject that the data

distribution of all the factors could not be proved, a
Kruskal-Wallis test was also performed. This test gave
the same result as the ANOVA test. The final test that it
would be desirable to perform is the Fisher PLSD test to
The alternative hypothesis was formulated such that there
is a significant difference between at least one pair of the
seven factors:

investigate the individual relationships in the data, but this
requires that the preconditions for the ANOVA be satisfied.
As the ANOVA provided the same result at 0.05 significance
level as the Kruskal-Wallis test, and taking into
account the robustness of the ANOVA test towards fit of
normality, the Fisher PLSD test was used nonetheless [171.
The whole analysis procedure is illustrated in Fig. 8.
The results of the PLSD show that the standardisation
factor is rated significantly higher than training, deployment,
maturity, support group and culture change. Tools is
rated significantly higher than support group and culture
change. Finally training, deployment and maturity are rated
significantly higher than support group. These relationships
are illustrated in Fig. 9. In Fig. 9, if hypothesis Ho is
rejected for a pair [nz,n] at the 0.05 level, this is denoted by
a S at the point of intersection between two factors. The
factors are ordered according to their arithmetic mean
rating.
The results indicate that the factors standardisation and
tools seem to be the most firmly anchored in the organisation.
To investigate whether this finding is tied to a specific
group, the analysis is continued by dividing the data into
the t w o different groups.
4.6.2 Identify discrepancies: For the purpose of
identifying discrepancies, the data were divided into two
groups according to the role of the subjects, the management
group and the engineer group. The hierarchical nature
of the organisation implies that there are more engineers
available to perform the comparisons. In total 10 managers
performed the comparisons, against 56 engineers. A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution was
performed on the data in each group as in the case with
the whole data set.
Next the hypotheses was formulated as follows:
H,: R(manager)n = R(engineer)n, n = 1, . . . , 7
H , :R(manager)n <> R(engineer)n, n = 1, . . . , 7

4.7.7 Conclusion validity: Reliability ojmenszrres is a
validity concern during the translation of the survey form
from English to Japanese. It is not certain that the translator
understands the context of the English version and therefore
may provide a translation that misleads the subjects. This
validity concern was reduced by arranging review sessions
with the author of the English text and English-speaking
process experts from Fuji Xerox. Cultural differences were
addressed by performing the case study over the relatively
The null hypothesis states that there is no statistical
difference between each pair of factors from the respective
group and the alternative hypothesis states that there is a
statistical difference.
Each factor was then compared between the groups
using a Mann-Whitney test. If no significant relationship
(0.05 level) was discovered by this and both groups were
normally distributed for the factor, a t-test was performed
instead. This analysis procedure is illustrated in Fig. 10.
Significant differences were found between the two
groups for factors maturity (using the Mann-Whitney
test) and standardisation (using the t-test). Next, the analysis
procedure performed for the entire data set was repeated
to investigate the rated relationships between the factors
within each group. The results for this analysis are
summarised in Figs. 1 1 and 12 for engineers and management,
respectively. It can be seen that the order of factors is
different in the two groups.
The results indicate that there is a difference between the
groups regarding maturity and standardisation. Note,
though, that the groups agree on the importance of tools.

long period of six months and by reviewing observations
with English-speaking members of Fuji Xerox staff.
The formulation of the factor descriptions and the
formulation of the instructions will affect the ways in
which the subjects complete the survey. The effects of
these validity concerns where reduced by putting a lot
of time into the construction of the survey and by test
running the form twice. Good consistency values during
the test runs and during the actual runs suggest that the
subjects have understood both the instructions for performing
the survey and the meaning of each factor.
The order of the ratings may affect the results from the
rating procedure. The randomisation of the rating order is
an attempt to reduce this factor.
ReliabiliQ of treatment implementation is a validity
concern for the survey as the form was applied over a
web interface so that there was no control of the environment
during the duration of the study. The subjects were
free to fill out the form in any situation they chose and it is
assumed that most of the subjects filled out the form at
his/her normal working place.
Random itwdevancies in experimental setting: the
effects of the subjects' normal working environment
cannot be eliminated as a validity threat as there was no
control over this.
Threats to the conclusion validity concerning statistical
tests are under control. The data were tested for normal
properties, and the tests applied (ANOVA and t-test) are
standard tests for the analysis. In the cases where normality
could not be established, nonparametric tests were used
instead (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests).
4.7.2 Internal validity: Maturation: The subjects
could become more acquainted with the different rating
factors as the survey progressed. The randomisation of the
order of the ratings should reduce this threat.
Instrumentation: Wordings in the web form affect the
grounds for the rating choices made and will therefore be
a validity threat. Wordings in the instructions to the rating
will affect the way the subjects perform the study and may
therefore threaten the validity. The relatively high level of
consistency and the general homogeneity of the results
suggests that the effects of these two threats are low, unless
the descriptions explicitly make a certain rating order
favourable.
Selection: The basis on which the subjects were selected
does not provide a correct sample from the group as Fuji
Xerox representatives chose projects that they were interested
in. The low response rate caused by the fact that there
was no method offorcing form completion means that only
subjects willing to fill out the form did so.
4.7.3 Construct validity: Inadequate preoperational
explication of constructs: Although great care was taken in
defining the constructs, the limited total time of the study
implied that there came a time when there was simply no more
time to work on these and the study had to be performed.
Evaluation apprehension: Subjects may purposely not
answer the survey to demonstrate how busy they are and
how devoted they are to working with their primary tasks.
4.7.4 External validity: The nature of the case-study
method usually implies low external reliability [161. As the
factors were identified using observations made at Fuji
Xerox the study has external limitations. Fuji Xerox,
however, faces the same challenges as most other large
corporations developing software. Making changes in the
IEE Proc.-Softw., Wd. 149, No. 5, October 2002
way the company functions takes an extremely long time
and standardisation is difficult owing to the large number
of people and opinions involved. The case study does,
however, show that the method presented in the paper is
useful in one software-engineering organisation and it
provides information useful to other companies interested
in trying the method.
4.7.5 Validity summary: The lack of control of the
environment where the subjects performed the tests
because of the web interface is a major validity threat,
together with translation and formulation effects in the
form itself. The main threat to internal validity in this study
is the selection of the subjects. Even though the results are
specific to Fuji Xerox, they can provide useful information
to other organisations in similar situations.
4.8 Case study summary
The case study shows that the factors can be prioritised and
that differences exist between different groups in the
company. In particular, the study shows that there are
several differences between subjects at the management
level and at the engineering level in the organisation.
The methods used in the case study prove adequate for
identifying the factors and performing a prioritisation
between the factors. The analytical hierarchy process
worked extremely well for rating the factors provided
from the case study. In particular, the ability to calculate
the consistency of the subjects gave a good idea of the
quality of the results obtained and also provided a means of
removing inconsistent subjects.
Note that the comparison between the groups showed a
significant difference in one of the most highly rated
factors overall, standardisation. This should have a major
impact on future SPI work. The Fuji Xerox management
group decided to investigate introducing standardisation of
low-level work processes through the use of some kind of
reference model such as the Personal Software Process [191
after the results of the investigation were presented.

Summary and conclusions
In a software-improvement programme, there is a risk that
the improvement strategy is not well anchored in the
organisation. Different persons in the organisation have
different viewpoints on what the process is, and how it
should be improved.
To support the establishment of an improvementprogramme
strategy, which takes these different viewpoints
into account, a method is developed and evaluated in a case
study at Fuji Xerox in Tokyo, Japan. The method supports
the improvement programme by providing decisionsupport
information for SPI work.
Based on a predetermined goal and a set of factors that
affect the goal, people from the organisation rate the
factors, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP),
which basically means painvise comparisons of the factors.
The AHP provides ranking of the factors as well as a
measure of how consistent the rankings are. There is also
an opportunity to compare the ranking throughout the
organisation and thereby identify any discrepancies. With
the information collected in this way, management is
expected to be able to make better decisions concerning
SPI strategy.
With the information at hand, which was derived by using
the method, it was shown in the case study that management
151
was able to make better decisions on which strategy to
choose, and how to create a more homogenous process
perception throughout the organisation. The method
provided information on the viewpoints of different stakeholders
in the organisation, which was a support in the
selection of improvement factors as well as in the identification
of change support needed. Further, the involvement of
people at different levels in the organisation provides in
itself a more firmly anchored improvement program.
