GQM+Strategies - aligning business strategies with software measurement. GQM+Strategies is a measurement approach that builds on the well-tested GQM approach to planning and implementing software measurement. Although GQM has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings, one recognized weakness is the difficulty for GQM users to link software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software measurement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level decisions. GQM+strategies provides mechanisms for explicitly linking software measurement goals, to higher-level goals for the software organization, and further to goals and strategies at the level of the entire business.
