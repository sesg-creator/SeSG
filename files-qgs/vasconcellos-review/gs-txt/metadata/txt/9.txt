QFD Application in Software Process Management and Improvement Based on CMM

Capability Maturity Model (CMM) from Software Engineering Institute has been used successfully by many organizations for software process improvement. However, there exists a disconnection between business goals and maturity levels. A new framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is developed to deal with this problem. This framework serves three purposes: (1) it provides a connection between business requirements and CMM; (2) it proposed a methodology for the priority assessment of requirements from multiple perspectives; and (3) it helps identify a set of software process improvement actions based on business requirements and CMM.
