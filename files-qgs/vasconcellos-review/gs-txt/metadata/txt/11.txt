The Rosetta Stone Methodology â€“ A Benefits-Driven Approach to SPI

The Rosetta Stone Methodology (RSM) has been developed which allows organizations to undertake Software Process Improvement (SPI) based on business- and organizational-driven goals and objectives. The methodology itself is fully customizable and allows organizations to make adjustments to the model where they feel it appropriate. To demonstrate the usefulness, appropriateness and practicality of this new approach, the Rosetta Stone IGSI-ISM to CMMI Instance mapping (RS-ICMMI) is developed. To aid in understanding, the Measurement and Analysis (MA) process area is used as an example of how to apply the methodology. The Rosetta Stone Methodology and the RS-ICMMI instance have been validated by experts.
