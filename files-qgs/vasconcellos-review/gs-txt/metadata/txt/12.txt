Interfacing three complementary technologies: strategic planning, process modeling, and system dynamics

Explores the utility and feasibility of interfacing three complementary technologies: (1) strategic planning, (2) process modeling, and (3) system dynamics to assist with the engineering of complex computer-based systems. Interfacing these technologies appears especially appropriate and timely. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 strives to make federal agencies operate more like businesses by requiring strategic plans and conducting performance audits. Process modeling technology aimed at providing assistance for the integrated product and process development (IPPD) approach for system development is being developed. In today's environment of perpetual change, a means of effectively predicting the impact of such changes on system development would be valuable. System dynamics modeling provides promise in this area. Since the product of strategic planning can be viewed as improved business and operational processes that will likely undergo major changes in response to events occurring in today's environment, there appears to be a natural synergy between application of these three technologies. The paper addresses exploitation of this natural synergy and hypothesizes that such exploitation would facilitate the development and operation of complex systems over the entire life cycle.
