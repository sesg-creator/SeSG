Code Smell Detection: Towards a Machine Learning-based Approach

Several code smells detection tools have been developed providing different results, because smells can be subjec- tively interpreted and hence detected in different ways. Usually the detection techniques are based on the computation of different kinds of metrics, and other aspects related to the domain of the system under analysis, its size and other design features are not taken into account. In this paper we propose an approach we are studying based on machine learning techniques. We outline some common problems faced for smells detection and we describe the different steps of our approach and the algorithms we use for the classification.
