BDTEX: A GQM-based Bayesian approach for the detection of antipatterns. The presence ofantipatterns can have a negative impact on the quality ofa program. Consequently, their efficient detection has drawn the attention ofboth researchers and practitioners. However, most aspects of antipatterns are loosely specified because quality assessment is ultimately a human-centric process that requires contextual data. Consequently, there is always a degree of uncertainty on whether a class in a program is an antipattern or not. None of the existing automatic detection approaches handle the inherent uncertainty ofthe detection process. First, wepresent BDTEX (Bayesian Detection Expert), a Goal Question Metric (GQM) based approach to build Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) from the definitions of antipatterns. We discuss the advantages of BBNs over rule-based models and illustrate BDTEX on the Blob antipattern. Second, we validate BDTEX with three antipatterns: Blob, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti code, and two open-source programs: GanttProject v1.10.2 and Xerces v2.7.0. We also compare the results of BDTEX with those of another approach, DECOR, in terms of precision, recall, and utility. Finally, we also show the applicability of our approach in an industrial context using Eclipse JDT and JHotDraw and introduce a novel classification ofantipatterns depending on the effort needed to map their definitions to automatic detection approaches.
