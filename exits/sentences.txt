BDTEX: A GQM-based Bayesian approach for the detection of antipatterns. The presence ofantipatterns can have a negative impact on the quality ofa program. Consequently, their efficient detection has drawn the attention ofboth researchers and practitioners. However, most aspects of antipatterns are loosely specified because quality assessment is ultimately a human-centric process that requires contextual data. Consequently, there is always a degree of uncertainty on whether a class in a program is an antipattern or not. None of the existing automatic detection approaches handle the inherent uncertainty ofthe detection process. First, wepresent BDTEX (Bayesian Detection Expert), a Goal Question Metric (GQM) based approach to build Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) from the definitions of antipatterns. We discuss the advantages of BBNs over rule-based models and illustrate BDTEX on the Blob antipattern. Second, we validate BDTEX with three antipatterns: Blob, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti code, and two open-source programs: GanttProject v1.10.2 and Xerces v2.7.0. We also compare the results of BDTEX with those of another approach, DECOR, in terms of precision, recall, and utility. Finally, we also show the applicability of our approach in an industrial context using Eclipse JDT and JHotDraw and introduce a novel classification ofantipatterns depending on the effort needed to map their definitions to automatic detection approaches. 
Classification model for code clones based on machine learning. Results from code clone detectors may contain plentiful useless code clones, but judging whether each code clone is useful varies from user to user based on a user’s purpose for the clone. In this research, we propose a classification model that applies machine learning to the judgments of each individual user regarding the code clones. To evaluate the proposed model, 32 participants completed an online survey to test its usability and accuracy. The result showed several important observations on the characteristics of the true positives of code clones for the users. Our classification model showed more than 70 % accuracy on average and more than 90 % accuracy for some particular users and projects. 
IDS: An Immune-inspired Approach for the Detection of Software Design Smells. We propose a parallel between object-oriented system designs and living creatures. We suggest that, like any living creature, system designs are subject to diseases, which are design smells (code smells and antipatterns). Design smells are conjectured in the literature to impact the quality and life of systems and, therefore, their detection has drawn the attention of both researchers and practitioners with various approaches. With our parallel, we propose a novel approach built on models of the immune system responses to pathogenic material. We show that our approach can detect more than one smell at a time. We build and test our approach on GanttProject v1.10.2 and Xerces v2.7.0, for which manually-validated and publicly-available smells exist. The results show a significant improvement in detection time, precision, and recall, in comparison to the state–of–the–art approaches. 
Can I Clone This Piece of Code Here?. While code cloning is a convenient way for developers to reuse existing code, it could potentially lead to negative impacts, such as degrading code quality or increasing maintenance costs. Actually, some cloned code pieces are viewed as harmless since they evolve independently, while other cloned code pieces are viewed as harmful since they need to be changed consistently, thus incurring extra maintenance costs. Recent studies demonstrate that neither the percentage of harmful code clones nor that of harmless code clones is negligible. To assist developers in leveraging the benefits of harmless code cloning and/or in avoiding the negative impacts of harmful code cloning, we propose a novel approach that automatically predicts the harmfulness of a code cloning operation at the point of performing copy-and-paste. Our insight is that the potential harmfulness of a code cloning operation may relate to some characteristics of the code to be cloned and the characteristics of its context. Based on a number of features extracted from the cloned code and the context of the code cloning operation, we use Bayesian Networks, a machine-learning technique, to predict the harmfulness of an intended code cloning operation. We evaluated our approach on two large-scale industrial software projects under two usage scenarios: 1) approving only cloning operations predicted to be very likely of no harm, and 2) blocking only cloning operations predicted to be very likely of harm. In the first scenario, our approach is able to approve more than 50% cloning operations with a precision higher than 94.9% in both subjects. In the second scenario, our approach is able to avoid more than 48% of the harmful cloning operations by blocking only 15% of the cloning operations for the first subject, and avoid more than 67% of the cloning operations by blocking only 34% of the cloning operations for the second subject. 
Support Vector Machines for Anti-pattern Detection. Developers may introduce anti-patterns in their software systems because of time pressure, lack of understanding, communication, and–or skills. Anti-patterns impede development and maintenance activities by making the source code more difficult to understand. Detecting anti-patterns in a is important to ease the maintenance of software. Detecting anti-patterns could reduce costs, effort, and resources. Researchers have proposed approaches to detect occurrences of anti-patterns but these approaches have currently some limitations: they require extensive knowledge of anti-patterns, they have limited precision and recall, and they cannot be applied on subsets of systems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SVMDetect, a novel approach to de- tect anti-patterns, based on a machine learning technique - support vector machines. Indeed, through an empirical study involving three subject systems and four anti-patterns, we showed that the accuracy of SVMDetect is greater than of DETEX when detecting anti-patterns occurrences on a set of classes. Concerning, the whole system, SVMDetect is able to find more anti-patterns occurrences than DETEX.
